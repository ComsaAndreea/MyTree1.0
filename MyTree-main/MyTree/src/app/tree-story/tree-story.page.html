      <p class = "paragraph">I was planted in a corner between the big walls of a church. I replaced a 100 year old tree, that has witnessed the revolution in 1989 and has seen generations and generations of students walk in and out of the “Brukenthal” school which is placed opposite to the church. That tree got hit by a tractor and is now firewood. It’s sad, I know, but now I get the chance to live and grow in this beautiful place. A century flies by, I grow and give people shelter during the hot summer days. During this century, people find out that the church has big static problems and needs to be renovated. So the noise begins: the first 5 years there are workers climbing on the roof, than they come down to the inside of the church and lastly they work on the outside of the church. Now it’s time for me to leave: the workers have to do some drilling on the spot where I have extended my roots. They dig me out and I loose my home and some branches. I remember thinking that now it’s over, that this is my last day. Surprisingly, it’s not. People plant me in the school yard of an art school. I’m the only tree here but I like being the first one to give some life to this grey patch of earth.

    <p class = "paragraph">There is a little green oase between the old defense wall of Sibiu and the rectory of the evanghelical church. This garden is my home. Even though the garden is oriented towards the north, I grew and got enaugh light. On my branches grow wonderful, sometimes sweet sometimes sour mirabelles. During summer the parish couple gathered the fruits and and made delicious jam out of it. I still rememder hearing them praise my fruit through the open kitchen window. Then, the parish people got a child. That little bundle of life screamed so much that all the birds left and my mirabelles got sour. The child screamed until the family came to the garden and made a picnic. The little human was laying underneath my branches and looked up to me, very fascinated. We stayed like this for a while, the child looking at me and me looking at the child. After that afternoon it rarely screamed again. My mirabelles were sweet again and the birds came back.
